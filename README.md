# Description

This repo is intended as starter kit and boilerplate to quickly kick start a React / NodeJS web application.
The aim is to not be particularly prescriptive or opinionated but offer a simple and clean way to getting a React Redux front-end environment paired with a NodeJS / Express API backend.

It does not use the absolute latest technologies on the market, in part to a protest about the endless churn in the Web Dev community.

I make no claim that this is perfect or even ideal - it just works, and offers a way for myself to get on with my projects in a straight-forward way with no unnecessary extras piled on.

There are no tests - sorry! 

# Usage

`npm install`

`gulp watch`

`node server/index.js`

Then navigate to `http://localhost:3000` which will serve files with `/dist/` as the root, via Express.

The example app will make a call to `/api/example` when the button is clicked - simply to demo a basic end-to-end system working. 

This project is basic, and not complete - it just helps to kick-start React Redux apps using a Node back-end.
