# Description

This repo is intended as starter kit and boilerplate to quickly kick start a React / NodeJS web application.
The aim is to not be particularly prescriptive or opinionated but offer a simple and clean way to getting a React Redux front-end environment paired with a NodeJS / Express API backend.

It does not use the absolute latest technologies on the market, in part to a protest about the endless churn in the Web Dev community.

I make no claim that this is perfect or even ideal - it just works, and offers a way for myself to get on with my projects in a straight-forward way with no unnecessary extras piled on.

There are no tests - sorry!
